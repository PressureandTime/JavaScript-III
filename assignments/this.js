/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. 
Window Binding refers to how this is the global context whenever a function is invoked
 without any of these other rules. 
 
If we aren't using a dot and we aren't using call(), apply(), or bind(), our this will be our global object.
If I am in the browser, this will be the Window

* 2. 
Implicit binding occurs when dot notation is used to invoke a function.
In implicit binding, whatever is to the left of the dot becomes the context for this in the function.

* 3. 



* 4. 
Explicit binding of this occurs when .call(), .apply(), or .bind() are used on a function.
We call these explicit because you are explicitly passing in a this context to call() or apply(). 

*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
